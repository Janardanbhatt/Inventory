########### How To Install Fake APIS ##########

# Create a folder name of your own choice on the desired location. For now, I have created with the name: Fake-APIs.

# Run npm init inside the folder. It'll prompt you with a set of questions and successfully create a package.json file.

# Run npm install — save json-server. It'll add the same dependency to the package.json file too. To install json-server globally, run npm install -g json-server.

# We need to start our server now. To do so, open the package.json file and add a key-value in the scripts object after line 7: "json:server":"json-server — watch db.json".

# Open the command prompt and navigate to the folder. Run the command:
npm run json:server. It'll run your server locally on http://localhost:3000

# You should see a file named db.json created in the folder. When you run the server locally, it tries to search for the file (db.json) and if not found, it creates a file on its own with mock JSON data.

# When you hit http://localhost:3000, you should see the following output. It has predefined 3 resources: posts, commands, profile. These resources are picked from the db.json file.


############# How to Run FrontEnd ##################

# Install node modules globally, As I have set a new port and updated it will run on port number 3006, http://localhost:3006 default Route is login will redirect to http://localhost:3000/login

# That's It enjoy...
